## 1. Planning Phase
- Demand forecasting by planning team
- Purchase quantity and lead time defined
- Replenishment strategy created

## 2. Purchase Order (PO)
- PO generated for each SKU (Stock Keeping Unit)
- Sent to vendor with quantity and delivery expectations

## 3. Receiving at Warehouse
- Items received at central warehouse
- Quality check (QC) performed by pickers
- Rejected items separated

## 4. Warehouse Management
- Items assigned to bins using Bin IDs
- Putaway method used for organized storage
- Pick and pack teams manage order fulfillment

## 5. Dispatch to Dark Stores
- Replenishment plans guide stock transfer
- Load dispatched based on projection
- Last-mile logistics arranged for fast delivery

Role of a Supply Chain Analyst in Q-Commerce
A Supply Chain Analyst plays a key role in ensuring fast, efficient, and data-driven operations from warehouse to dark stores in a quick commerce environment. The responsibilities include:

1. Planning & Projection
Analyze sales and order data to create demand forecasts.

Project inventory requirements at both warehouses and dark stores.

Avoid overstocking or stockouts by using data-backed projections.

2. Manpower Estimation
Predict the number of pickers, packers, and loaders required per shift.

Ensure optimal workforce planning during high-demand periods (e.g., weekends, festivals).

3. Picking & Packing Efficiency
Track metrics like items picked per hour, packing accuracy, and cycle time.

Recommend layout or process changes to reduce delays and errors.

4. Logistics Optimization
Analyze transportation costs, delivery times, and vehicle utilization.

Recommend route optimizations or zonal mapping to reduce last-mile delays.

Monitor real-time vehicle performance and suggest improvements.

5. ⏱Stock Loading Time
Measure and improve the turnaround time from item picking to vehicle loading.

Use data to identify bottlenecks and improve dock efficiency.

Real-Time Conflict Scenario (Problem Solving Skill)
Situation:
There is ongoing conflict between the warehouse and dark store teams. The warehouse sends loads on time, but the dark store claims that loads are delayed or not received as expected.

Analytical Resolution:
As a Supply Chain Analyst, I would:

Implement real-time tracking of vehicle movement using GPS-integrated systems.

Create a dashboard to track dispatch and arrival timestamps.

Add a trigger notification system (via SMS or app) that alerts the dark store when the vehicle:

Leaves the warehouse

Is nearing the delivery location (geo-fencing)

Analyze past delivery time logs to find whether the delay lies in dispatch, transit, or receiving.

This ensures transparency, accountability, and removes human bias from the blame loop — helping both teams collaborate better.
